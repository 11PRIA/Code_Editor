## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Write your code**
   - Enter your HTML (body content only), CSS, and JS in their respective panels.
   - _Do not include `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<style>`, or `<script>` tags._
2. **See instant results**
   - The output area below updates live as you type.
   - You can resize the output area by dragging its bottom edge.
3. **Enjoy the workflow!**
   - Use the editor to prototype, learn, or share code snippets easily.

```

## 💡 Tips

- For best results, only write the content you would put inside `<body>` in the HTML panel.
